Do you have some siblings that are annoying and randomly take your stuff everyday? I made the perfect thing for you. I call this the Anti-Sibling machine. It uses a EV3 Mindstorms robot, and some pressure sensors and some other sensors like the supersonic sensor too. You can create a combination code, and an alarm will sound when your items are removed from the sensor. Another optional item is the supersonic sensor that detects when your siblings enter the room, which also sounds an alarm, you use a red "card" to disable the alarm and enter the original combination to deactivate the alarm. I've created a similar project before, and it was really handy.
